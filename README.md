Description
This website was created as part of a recruitment challenge provided by Wexo. It allows users to explore popular movies and movies by genre using data from the TMDB API. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, due to time constraints, certain features such as displaying more details about individual movies were not fully implemented.

Features
Home Screen: The homepage displays a basic layout without any specific functionality, acting as an introduction to the site.
Popular Movies: A link in the navbar shows the 20 most popular movies at the moment.
Genres: A dropdown menu in the navbar displays genres dynamically. By selecting a genre, users can view 20 movies per page in that genre.
Pagination: At the bottom of each page, users can navigate between pages using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
API Integration: The site pulls movie data from the TMDB API.
Usage
When you visit the website, you’ll land on the home screen.
Use the Popular link in the navbar to view the 20 most popular movies.
Click on the Genres button in the navbar, then select a genre to see the 20 most popular movies for that genre, with pagination at the bottom for navigation between pages.
Note:

The "More" button for additional movie details was not implemented due to time constraints.
Limitations
The "More" button on the movie cards was planned to display detailed information about a movie, but due to limited time, this feature wasn’t completed.
The website design is basic and has not been fully polished.
The search bar in the index/home screen dosent work
Future Improvements
Add functionality for displaying detailed movie information when clicking "More".
Enhance the UI/UX design for a more polished appearance.
Add search functionality for users to search for specific movies.
